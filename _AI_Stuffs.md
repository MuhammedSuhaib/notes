# 📚 12. AI-Related Concepts

### 🤖 Core AI Terms
- **Machine Programming** – Machine follows explicit instructions.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** – Machines learn from data/examples.
- **Deep Learning (DL)** – Easier ML using neural networks.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** – Understanding human language.
- **Autonomous AI** – Acts without human help (e.g., self-driving cars).

### 🧠 Types of AI
- **ANI** – Narrow, task-specific intelligence.
- **AGI** – Human-level general intelligence.
- **ASI** – Superintelligence (future concept).

### 📦 AI as a Service
- **SaaS** – Software over the internet, no install needed.
- **RaaS** – Get results as a service (AI-driven outputs).

# 🔤 Programming Concepts

### 🔼 High-Level Languages  
- Easy to understand  
- Less control  
> **Eg:** Python, JavaScript

### 🔽 Low-Level Languages  
- Harder to understand  
- More control  
> **Eg:** C, Assembly

---

### 🧵 Interpreter  
- Executes code **line by line**  
> **Eg:** Python

### ⏱️ Synchronous Programming  
- One task at a time  
> **Eg:** Python runs top-down

### ⚡ Asynchronous Programming  
- Multiple tasks can run in parallel  
> **Eg:** `async/await` in JS for API calls

---
 **Prototype**- Draft model before the final one (sometimes it means the earliest version).
